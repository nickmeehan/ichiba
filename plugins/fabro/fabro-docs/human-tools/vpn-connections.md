# VPN Connections

> Connect sandbox environments to private networks via VPN

<Warning>
  VPN connections are **coming soon** and not yet available. This page describes the planned feature.
</Warning>

VPN connections enable sandboxes to connect to private networks, giving agents access to internal services, databases, and APIs that aren't reachable over the public internet.

## Use cases

* **Access private services** — connect to internal APIs, databases, or staging environments behind a corporate firewall
* **Test against production-like infrastructure** — reach services on a private network without exposing them publicly
* **Team collaboration** — share a VPN network so sandboxes and developer machines can communicate directly

## Supported providers

| Provider      | Authentication            | Best for                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Tailscale** | Browser login or auth key | Mesh networking, zero-config connectivity       |
| **OpenVPN**   | Client configuration file | Corporate VPNs, existing OpenVPN infrastructure |

## How it works

When VPN is enabled, Fabro installs the VPN client inside the sandbox, connects to the specified network, and verifies connectivity before the workflow begins. Once connected, the sandbox receives a VPN IP address and can reach all resources on the private network.

### Tailscale

Tailscale provides two authentication methods:

* **Auth key** — non-interactive authentication suitable for automated runs and CI/CD pipelines. You provide a Tailscale auth key and the sandbox connects without manual intervention.
* **Browser login** — interactive authentication where Fabro generates a login URL. You visit the URL in your browser to authorize the sandbox device on your Tailscale network.

### OpenVPN

OpenVPN uses a client configuration file (`.ovpn`) containing connection parameters, certificates, and encryption settings. The sandbox installs the OpenVPN client, uploads the configuration, and connects in the background.

## Example workflow

With a VPN connection configured, agents can reach internal services like a private database. This workflow investigates a performance issue by querying the staging database directly:

```dot theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
digraph InvestigateSlowQuery {
    graph [goal="Identify and fix the slow query causing timeouts on the orders page"]

    start [shape=Mdiamond, label="Start"]
    exit  [shape=Msquare, label="Exit"]

    analyze [label="Analyze Slow Queries", prompt="Connect to the staging database at staging-db.internal:5432 and run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the queries used by the orders page. Identify the slowest query."]
    fix     [label="Fix Query", prompt="Add or modify indexes and rewrite the slow query to resolve the performance issue. Verify the fix with EXPLAIN ANALYZE."]
    review  [shape=hexagon, label="Review Changes"]

    start -> analyze -> fix -> review
    review -> exit [label="[A] Approve"]
    review -> fix  [label="[R] Revise"]
}
```

## Verification

After connecting, Fabro verifies the VPN connection by checking that the sandbox has a VPN interface and can reach the private network. If the connection fails, the run reports the error before workflow execution begins.
