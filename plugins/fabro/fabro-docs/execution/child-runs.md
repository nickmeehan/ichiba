# Child Runs

> Spawn and supervise additional Fabro runs from a parent run

A Fabro run can orchestrate other Fabro runs. An agent in the parent run can create child runs, inspect them, wait for them, and control them while the parent continues coordinating the larger job.

Child runs are full workflow runs. Each child has its own run ID, workflow, lifecycle, sandbox, events, checkpoints, artifacts, and outputs. The parent-child relationship gives Fabro a durable way to show, query, and manage the orchestration tree.

## When to use child runs

Use child runs when the unit of work is large enough to deserve its own workflow run:

* **Parallel workstreams** - launch implementation, review, migration, or validation runs at the same time.
* **Specialized workflows** - delegate to purpose-built workflows for different repos, services, or review types.
* **Long-running work** - let the parent keep coordinating while children run independently.
* **Manager patterns** - build a parent workflow that creates workers, watches progress, gathers results, and decides what happens next.
* **Variants and attempts** - run multiple approaches as separate durable runs with separate outputs.

For small subtasks inside one agent stage, use [sub-agents](/agents/subagents). For reusable workflow structure inside one run, use [sub-workflows](/tutorials/sub-workflow) or [imports](/workflows/imports).

## Enable run tools

Workflow agents can create and manage runs when the parent run opts in to Fabro's run-management tool catalog:

```toml title="run.toml" theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
[run.agent]
fabro_tools = true
```

This exposes the same Fabro run tools available through [MCP](/agents/mcp):

| Tool                            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fabro_workflow_version_create` | Register supplied workflow files and return an immutable version ID                               |
| `fabro_run_create`              | Create one or more child runs, starting them by default                                           |
| `fabro_run_search`              | Search runs, including direct children by `parent_id`                                             |
| `fabro_run_get`                 | Inspect a run without mutating it                                                                 |
| `fabro_run_interact`            | Start, message, interrupt, cancel, archive, unarchive, link, unlink, inspect, or answer questions |
| `fabro_run_gather`              | Wait for runs to reach terminal states                                                            |
| `fabro_run_events`              | Read stored events for a run                                                                      |
| `fabro_run_pair`                | Pair with an active API-mode agent stage                                                          |

<Note>
  When a workflow agent calls `fabro_run_create`, Fabro always parents the created runs to the current run. If the agent supplies `parent_id`, it must match the current run ID.
</Note>

## Create child runs

Acquire workflow files with the agent's shell/read tools, then call
`fabro_workflow_version_create` with their contents:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "entrypoint": "workflow.fabro",
  "files": {
    "workflow.fabro": "digraph Child { start [shape=Mdiamond] work [prompt=\"@prompt.md\"] exit [shape=Msquare] start -> work -> exit }",
    "prompt.md": "Implement the requested change and run the relevant tests."
  }
}
```

Use the returned `workflow_version_id` in `fabro_run_create`:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "runs": [{
    "workflow_version_id": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "goal": "Implement the checkout page refactor and run its tests.",
    "args": { "labels": { "lane": "checkout", "source": "parent-run" } },
    "start": true
  }]
}
```

A version can be reused for several children, each with its own goal, target, and
`args`. When the version already exists, skip registration. Read goal files with
the agent's read tool and pass literal `goal` text. Workflow names, paths, inline
source objects, and `goal_file` are no longer run-create inputs.

This flow works in Local, Docker, and Daytona environments. The agent can clone a
remote workflow in its sandbox and submit the resulting contents. Fabro's native
tool handler executes outside the sandbox, so registration treats file-map keys
as virtual relative paths and never reads sandbox paths from the worker host.
Include the workflow's referenced configuration, prompts, and child workflows in
the supplied tree. See [MCP](/agents/mcp) for package limits.

Workflow content and workspace target are independent. If `target` is omitted,
a native child inherits the parent's canonical target: `none` or folder as-is,
and a Git target's repository and current execution branch (normally
`fabro/run/<parent-id>`). Push parent changes before creating the child; a child
clone sees that branch's remote HEAD. The parent's original pinned SHA/tag is
not inherited. If run branches are disabled, the original input branch is used;
if an enabled execution branch is unavailable, send an explicit target.

An explicit Git, `none`, or folder target overrides inheritance while the current
run remains the forced parent. Set `sha` on an explicit Git target to pin a child.
Server admission enforces folder access: Docker/Daytona parents cannot select a
server-host folder, including by requesting a Local child environment.
Standalone MCP always requires an explicit target, even with `parent_id`.

Use `environment_id` to choose a server environment; omission uses the server
default, not the parent's environment. Run overrides belong in canonical `args`:
`inputs`, `labels`, `model`, `provider`, `auto_approve`, `dry_run`, and
`preserve_sandbox`. Omission preserves workflow/server defaults; explicit `false`
is not omitted. The tool does not apply caller, project, or machine run settings.
Keep workflow-owned configuration in the registered `workflow.toml`.

Creation and start remain separate operations. Set `start: false` to leave a
child submitted. A batch stops on its first failure; if any runs have already
been created, their IDs appear in the error so the parent can inspect them
instead of recreating them blindly.

## Start and approval

Child run creation and child run execution are separate steps:

1. **Create** - `fabro_run_create` creates a durable run record with the current run as parent.
2. **Start request** - if `start` is true, Fabro requests execution for the child.
3. **Approval if required** - parent-generated child runs may enter `pending` with `approval_required`.
4. **Schedule** - after approval, the child becomes `runnable` and the scheduler starts it when capacity is available.
5. **Execute** - the child runs its own workflow and writes its own events, checkpoints, artifacts, and outputs.

The approval step prevents a workflow agent from recursively launching executing runs without an operator checkpoint. Approve or deny pending child runs from the web UI or through the run lifecycle API.

## Supervise children

A parent run can keep track of the children it creates.

List direct children:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "parent_id": "01KRTKP5DJJ4EV6T7QSB081Z1N"
}
```

Wait for children to finish:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "run_ids": [
    "01KRTM8V3WQ6E9M2A2R6B3G8HK",
    "01KRTM91N7W9S6BP2RZ6SXX4FR"
  ],
  "timeout_seconds": 1800
}
```

Inspect a child:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "run_id": "01KRTM8V3WQ6E9M2A2R6B3G8HK"
}
```

Cancel a child that is no longer useful:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "action": "cancel",
  "run_id": "01KRTM8V3WQ6E9M2A2R6B3G8HK"
}
```

Read a child's events:

```json theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
{
  "run_id": "01KRTM8V3WQ6E9M2A2R6B3G8HK",
  "limit": 100
}
```

Child listings are direct. To walk a larger tree, list each child as a parent and repeat.

## Web UI

Run detail pages include a **Children** tab. It lists runs whose `parent_id` is the current run, shows a count badge on the tab, supports refresh, filtering, sorting, and archived-run visibility, and uses the same run list layout as the main runs page.

Use this tab when you want to see the work a manager run delegated, jump into a child run, inspect child output, or verify that a child has finished.

## CLI and API

You can also create and organize child runs outside a workflow agent.

Create a run under an existing parent:

```bash theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
fabro run child.fabro --parent parent-run
fabro create child.fabro --parent parent-run
```

List direct children:

```bash theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
fabro ps --parent parent-run
```

Repair or reorganize relationships:

```bash theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
fabro parent link child-run parent-run
fabro parent unlink child-run
```

The HTTP API exposes the same model:

| Operation                            | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `POST /api/v1/runs` with `parent_id` | Create a run under a parent    |
| `GET /api/v1/runs?parent_id=...`     | List direct children           |
| `PUT /api/v1/runs/{id}/parent`       | Link or replace a run's parent |
| `DELETE /api/v1/runs/{id}/parent`    | Remove a run's parent link     |
| `POST /api/v1/runs/{id}/approve`     | Approve a pending child run    |
| `POST /api/v1/runs/{id}/deny`        | Deny a pending child run       |

## Relationship rules

Parent-child links are orchestration metadata:

* A run can have one parent and any number of direct children.
* Creating or linking a child requires the parent run to exist.
* Self-parenting and cycles are rejected.
* Parent links can be changed for active, terminal, and archived runs.
* A child can keep its historical parent reference even if the parent run is later removed.
* Parent-child links are not fork or rewind lineage. Fork and rewind use separate source fields.
