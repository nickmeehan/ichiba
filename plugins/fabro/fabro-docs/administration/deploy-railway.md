# Railway

> Deploy Fabro to Railway from the prebuilt GHCR image, with a persistent Volume for state

<Warning>

</Warning>

[Railway](https://railway.com) can host the Fabro server by pulling the pre-built image published to GHCR. A single deploy button spins up a container, and a Railway Volume keeps your runs, checkpoints, and sessions across redeploys.

## One-click deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/UcEy5m?referralCode=E5TucU\&utm_medium=integration\&utm_source=template\&utm_campaign=generic)

The button launches Railway's template flow, which deploys the pre-built `ghcr.io/fabro-sh/fabro:nightly` image directly from GHCR — no Rust compilation on Railway's builder, so deploys complete in seconds.

## First-deploy checklist

The template covers the build; a few pieces still need to be wired up after the first deploy.

### 1. Attach a Volume for `/storage`

Fabro writes all persistent state — run history, checkpoints, sessions, the default token, and JWT keys — under `/storage`. Railway containers have ephemeral filesystems, so without a Volume that directory is wiped on every redeploy.

In the Railway dashboard: **Service → Settings → Volumes → New Volume**, mount path `/storage`. 10 GB is a reasonable starting size; grow as needed.

### 2. Confirm the target port

Railway sets `$PORT` automatically and expects the container to bind to it. The Fabro image honors `$PORT` and falls back to `32276`, and it exposes `32276`, so Railway's default HTTP routing works without any manual port configuration.

If you override the port in **Service → Settings → Networking → Target Port**, match the value to `$PORT`.

### 3. Set bootstrap environment variables

Add variables in **Service → Variables** as needed. The [Server Configuration](/administration/server-configuration) reference has the full list. Railway process env is for bootstrap values only:

| Variable                                                          | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FABRO_DEV_TOKEN`                                                 | Optional — pre-set the dev token instead of reading the one written to `/storage` on first boot |
| `SESSION_SECRET`                                                  | 64-character hex string; required when the web UI is enabled                                    |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | Optional static S3 object-store credentials                                                     |

Do not put optional integration secrets in Railway variables for server runtime. After the server is running, add LLM provider keys, Slack, Daytona, Brave Search, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub App secrets to the server vault with `fabro secret set`, `fabro provider login`, or `fabro install`.

No `.env` file is auto-loaded inside the container; bootstrap variables come from Railway's environment.

## Accessing your Fabro server

Once the deploy is healthy, Railway exposes a `*.up.railway.app` URL (or your custom domain). Two things to grab:

1. **The dev token** — on first boot, Fabro writes one to `/var/fabro/dev-token` and logs it. Find it in the Railway deploy logs or run `railway run cat /var/fabro/dev-token` from the Railway CLI.
2. **Point your local CLI at the server** — add the Railway URL to `~/.fabro/settings.toml`:

   ```toml title="~/.fabro/settings.toml" theme={"languages":{"custom":["/languages/dot.json","/languages/fabro.json"]}}
   [cli.target]
   type = "http"
   url = "https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/api/v1"
   ```

   Then commands like `fabro model list --server <url>` will hit your Railway instance.

See [Server Operations](/reference/server-operations) for the full auth and CLI-pointing story.

## Redeploys and updates

Railway re-pulls the GHCR image on every deploy. The template uses the `:nightly` tag by default, so redeploying picks up the latest nightly automatically. To pin a specific version, change the image in **Service → Settings → Source** to `ghcr.io/fabro-sh/fabro:<version>` and redeploy. The `/storage` Volume survives redeploys, so runs and checkpoints persist.

## Caveats

* **Volume is load-bearing.** Without a Volume mounted at `/storage`, a redeploy silently wipes all state — including the dev token and JWT signing keys. Attach it before submitting any real runs.
* **Single replica.** Fabro's server currently assumes one process owns `/storage`. Don't scale the service to multiple replicas.
* **Architecture.** Railway runs x86\_64 (amd64) containers by default. The `:nightly` tag is multi-arch, but the arm64 variant is not currently usable — stay on amd64, which is Railway's default.
