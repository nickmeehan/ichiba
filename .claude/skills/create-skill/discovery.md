# Discovery: Understanding the Skill

Gather concrete examples before building anything. Skip this step only when the
skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood.

## Key Questions

Ask the user (avoid overwhelming with all at once — start with the most important):

1. **Functionality**: "What functionality should this skill support?"
2. **Concrete examples**: "Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"
3. **Trigger phrases**: "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"
4. **Edge cases**: "Are there variations or special cases to handle?"

## Generating Examples

When the user doesn't have examples ready, propose likely scenarios:

> "I can imagine users asking for things like '[example A]' or '[example B]'.
> Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"

## Conclude When

There is a clear sense of:
- What the skill does (core functionality)
- How it gets triggered (user phrases and keywords)
- What concrete tasks it handles (specific examples)

## Next Step

Proceed to planning reusable contents — analyze each example:
1. How would you execute this task from scratch?
2. What scripts, references, or assets would help when doing this repeatedly?
